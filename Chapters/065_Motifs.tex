Non-random connectivity in local cortical circuits extends well beyond
specific connection probability in neuron pairs: As one of their main
results, \textcite{Song2005} report a characteristic occurrence of
motifs of three neurons, while \textcite{Perin2011} find patterns in
the number of connections appearing in clusters of up to 8
neurons. Motifs have been shown to have a significant influence on
network dynamics, with patterns affecting dynamical
correlations \parencite{Pernice2011} and network
synchrony \parencite{Zhao2011}.

Finding no correlation between two-neuron connection probabilities and
anisotropy in connectivity prior, does anisotropy influence the
occurrence of neuron motifs? In this section we analyze higher order
connectivity in the different network types and observe a surprisingly
strong impact of anisotropy on patterns of connected neurons,
promoting the concept as an underlying principle for non-random
network connectivity.



\subsection*{Three-neuron patterns}

We first investigate the occurrence of three-neuron patterns in
an\-iso\-tro\-pic networks. \textcite{Song2005} reported a
characteristic, highly non-ran\-dom motif distribution of pyramidal
cells in the rat's visual cortex layer 5, a result later confirmed by
\textcite{Perin2011} in their experiment in the rat's somatosensory
cortex layer 5. Repeating the experiment \textit{in silico} for the
different networks subject to this study, we find similar,
characteristic motif distributions strongly influenced by anisotropy
in connectivity.

\vspace{-0.8cm} Let $X$ be a random variable that maps three random
vertices $v_1 \neq v_2 \neq v_3$ in a graph $G$ to the $n \in
\{4,5,\dots,16\}$ labeling the isomorphism class of the full subgraph
with vertex set $\{v_1,v_2,v_3\}$ in $G$ as above if the subgraph is
connected, and let $X$ map to $n=0$ otherwise. A first idea of how to
compute the distribution of $X$ is by inferring the probabilities of
motif occurrence from the two-neuron connection probabilities from
Section~\ref{sec:two_neuron}. In anisotropic networks we found that
the probabilities of occurrence are 
\begin{align*} 
  p_u & = 0.791336     &&\text{for unconnected pairs,}     \\
  p_s & = 0.184151     &&\text{for single connections and} \\
  p_r & = 0.024513     &&\text{for reciprocal connections.}
\end{align*}
From these we may, for example, calculate the probability of
occurrence for motif 8, 
\[
  \mathbf{P}(X=8) = 6\, p_{u} p_{s} p_{r},
\]
where the factor 6 is determined by the number of different
\textit{labeled} graphs belonging to the isomorphism class. The
distribution of $X$ for the remaining motifs is given by \\

    Extracting the counts of three-node motifs in anisotropic (filled
    bars) and distance-dependent networks (unfilled bars), the
    quotient of the obtained count with the number of occurrences
    expected from the two-neuron connection probabilities in the
    networks (cf. Section~\ref{sec:two_neuron}) shows the over- and
    underrepresentation of specific motifs in the network (red and
    black errorbars are SEM). In anisotropic networks pattern 12, for
    example, appears around five times more often than we would expect
    from the occurrence two-neuron connections. The relative counts
    for anisotropic networks resemble the findings of
    \textcite{Song2005} and differ significantly from the counts in

Does this distribution accurately reflect the occurrences of
three-neuron motifs in anisotropic or even distance-dependent
networks? Here we take the distribution \marginpar{distribution from
  neuron-pairs as reference} determined from the two-neuron
probabilities as a reference to analyze occurrences of three-neuron
motifs in our sets of sample graphs. Counting the occurrences of
patterns in we find that there are significant over- and
underrepresentations in anisotropic as well as distance-dependent
networks, relative to our expectation
(\autoref{fig:3motif_single}). We find, for example, that in
anisotropic graphs pattern 12 occurs almost 5 times as often as we
would have expected from the two-neuron probabilities, whereas
the counts for pattern 11 only make up less than $30\%$ of the
occurrences expected.

Comparing the relative counts for motifs in anisotropic graphs with
those in comparable distance-dependent networks, we
\marginpar{anisotropy strongly affects 3-motif
  occurrence}identify a strong influence of anisotropy in connectivity
on three-neuron motif occurrence (\autoref{fig:3motif_single}). In
their experiments, Song et al.\ and Perin et al.\ find an
overrepresentation of motifs 4, 10, 12 and 14. In anisotropic networks
increased counts of motifs 4, 8, 10, 12, 13 and 14 were
recorded. However, motifs 8 and 13 are overrepresented in
distance-dependent networks as well, leaving the reported motifs 4,
10, 12 and 14 as motifs that are overrepresented due to anisotropy. To
analyze this effect closer, we also compare three-neuron counts before
and after rewiring in anisotropic networks
(\autoref{fig:3motif_full}).

Considering motif occurrences in anisotropic as well as tuned
anisotropic networks, we once again confirm the overrepresentation of
motifs 4, 10, 12 and 14. However, increased counts of pattern 4 are
observed in the rewired networks as well, leading to the conclusion
that increased occurrence in this motif is only implicitly affected by
anisotropy. Motifs 10, 12 and 14 however show significant
overrepresentation even over their rewired counterparts in anisotropic
as well as in tuned anisotropic networks.

The overall motif distribution shows itself stable under changes in
the distance-dependency with the notable exception of motif 9, that
shows underrepresentation only in anisotropic but not in tuned
anisotropic or any distance-dependent network type. Analyzing the
occurrences of motifs 15 and 16 with a high edge counts
(\autoref{fig:3motif_full} C) we find that anisotropy has strong
influence on both motifs, with motif 15 being significantly
overrepresented in anisotropic networks. Motif 16 shows a highly
increased occurrence in anisotropic networks, however tuning causes
the loss of this feature in the network connectivity.

Summarizing the above observations, we find that \marginpar{results
  summary} anisotropy in connectivity induces increased occurrence of
motifs 10, 12, 14 and 15 in the network, reflecting experimental
results in the rat's cortex.  While over- and underrepresentation
observed in local cortical circuits can be indirectly linked to
anisotropy for some motifs (4, 9), it does not accurately reflect
observed counts for other motifs (8) and shows instability under
manipulation of distance-dependency in some patterns (9, 16).


\subsection*{Motif occurrence in networks}

In obtaining and discussing the previous results, we closely followed
the approach described by \textcite{Song2005}. Here, relying on
analytical considerations, we submit these results to a critical
analysis and identify potential caveats when dealing with motif
distributions in distance-dependent networks.

Consider for this, for example, the motifs 9, 15 and 16 as labeled
above. In distance-dependent networks we find that each of these are
overrepresented, observing that the motifs occur about 3, 3 and 12
times more often than expected from the two-neuron connection
probabilities, respectively.





The \enquote{true} overrepresentation may thus be identified as 1,1,4
composing a different. How does this affect the results described
above? As distant-dependent networks are clearly However, here we
relied on finding impacts of anisotropy on networks, finding only
relative. Such an analysis Closely inspecting the results of Song et
al., we identify this problem in motifs 4, 10 and 12, each being
reported as overrepresented although together making up a two neuron
pairs with single connections each, implying a potentially biased
selection of neuron triplets.








%\newpage
\subsection*{Edge counts in neuron clusters}

In motifs consisting of 3 to 8 neurons, \textcite{Perin2011} reported
a striking statistic from their experiment with pyramidal cells in the
rat's somatsosensory cortex, layer 5: Counting the number of edges
appearing in a cluster of $n$ neurons, they find that clusters with
relatively high edge counts appear significantly more often than
expected from the network's distance-dependent connection
probabilities alone. Do anisotropic networks exhibit a similar
feature?

    overrepresentation of high edge counts in networks with anisotropy
    in connectivity. Errorbars SEM. (\smtcite{??})}
  \label{fig:perin6to12}
\end{figure}

Recruiting the collection of sample graphs once again we analyze the
occurrence of edge counts in clusters of $n$ neurons in the different
network types. In the main process, after randomly sampling $n$
pairwise different vertices $S_n$, the motif $H$ in $G$ with vertex
set $V(H) = S_n$ is identified and its number of edges $\abs{E(H)}$ is
recorded. Repeating this sufficiently often (order $10^6$) we obtain
edge counts for clusters of 6,8 and 12 neurons in the anisotropic- and
tuned anisotropic networks as well as in their rewired
counterparts. Then, showing the difference between counts in the
anisotropic networks and counts in the rewired networks, normalized by
the rewired counts, we identify an overrepresentation of high edge
counts in the neuron similar to Perin et al.\
(\autoref{fig:perin6to12}).

In anisotropic networks an overrepresentation of high edge counts is
found consistently through clusters of 6, 8 and 12 neurons, with the
highest counts appearing up to four times as often as expected. Low
edge counts occur less frequently than expected and an increasing
number of connections shows an oscillation around the
expectation. These findings are consistent with the report of Perin et
al, which however indicates a higher maximal overrepresentation in
clusters of 8 neurons. 

Tuning the network's distance-dependency appears to not affect the
overrepresentation as edge counts in anisotropic and tuned
an\-iso\-tro\-pic essentially match
(\autoref{fig:perin6to12}). Anisotropy in connectivity therefore
presents itself as an important factor in the occurrence of increased
high edge counts in cortical networks, possibly fully reflecting the
findings of Perin et al., as the overrepresentation effect is found to
be even stronger when comparing edge counts to distance-dependent
networks as opposed to rewired versions (\autoref{fig:perin_rew_dist}).
