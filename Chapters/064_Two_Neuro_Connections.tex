\section{Two Neuron Connections}\label{sec:two_neuron}

% Makram 1997, Song 2005. Perin2011

Connectivity in local cortical circuits exhibits a salient feature:
Examining the occurrence of connections in neuron pairs, studies have
repeatedly found that bidirectionally connected neuron pairs appear
much more frequently than expected from the network's overall
connection probability. In layer 5 of the somatsosensory cortex
studies from \textcite{Markram1997_TL5} and \textcite{Perin2011} have
found an overrepresentation of reciprocally connected pairs of thick
tufted pyramidal cells, an observation that has also been reported in
layer 2/3 \parencite{Holmgren2003} and layer 5 \parencite{Song2005} of
the visual cortex. The overrepresentation of bidirectionally connected
pairs is significant, Song et al.~for example found such pairs
represented four times the expected amount.

The underlying connection principle imposing this overrepresentation
on the network however remains unclear. Song et al.~discuss the
possibility of known learning rules to explain their findings, leaving
a definitive answer open to further investigation. More recent studies
find overrepresentation of reciprocally connected pairs \textit{in
  vitro} resulting from functional specificity \parencite{Ko2011} and
\textit{in silico} from dense neuron clustering
rules \parencite{Klinshov2014}, identifying specific network
characteristics that may contribute to the reported overrepresentation
\textit{in vivo}. 

% Is anisotropy in connectivity a possible underlying
% connection principle inducing the occurrence of bidirectional
% connections?  Here we investigate whether anisotropy in connectivity
% can be at cause for the overrepresentation of reciprocally connected
% pairs in cortical circuits.

Here we examine anisotropy in connectivity as a possible candidate for
an underlying principle explaining the characteristic two neuron
connection distribution. In random networks, the chance to encounter a
specific mode of connection in a random pair of neurons be can easily
be computed from the overall connection probability $p$. For this let
$X$ be the random variable of the number of edges between two
different vertices in a Gilbert graph $G(n,p)$ with $n \ge 2$. As the
edges are independently realized, resulting in a simple directed
graph, we have
\vspace{0.1cm}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:pairs}
  \begin{aligned}%
    & \mathbf{P}(X=0) = (1-p)^2    &&\text{unconnected pair,}  \\
    & \mathbf{P}(X=1) = 2p(1-p)    &&\text{single connection,}\\
    & \mathbf{P}(X=2) = p^2        &&\text{reciprocal connection};
  \end{aligned}%
\end{equation}
\vspace{0.1cm} \\
in short $\mathbf{P}(X=k) = \mathcal{B}_{2,p}(k)$ for $k \in
\{0,1,2\}$ and $\mathbf{P}(X=k) = 0$ otherwise. Using this probability
distribution as the expectation for connectivity of neuron pairs in
the various network types, a numeric analysis of the anisotropic
sample graphs reveals that bidirectionally connected pairs appear
almost twice as often as expected from the overall connection
probability ($p=0.116$) and equations \ref{eq:pairs}, similarly as
reported by Song et al.~(\autoref{fig:two_neuron_probs} A). However,
comparing the pair probabilities in anisotropic networks with the
probabilities in their rewired counterparts, we find that anisotropy
does not influence the occurrence of two-neuron motifs
(\autoref{fig:two_neuron_probs} B) In fact, expected connections in
neuron pairs are identical in distance-dependent and rewired
anisotropic networks (\autoref{suppfig:two_neurons_dist_rew}).

      anisotropic networks due to distance-dependent connectivity}
    Extracting the counts of unconnected, one-directionally and
    bidirectionally connected neuron pairs in the anisotropic sample
    graphs, overrepresentation of reciprocally connected pairs is
    identified as a feature of the network's distance dependency as
    opposed to anisotropy in connectivity. \textbf{A)} Showing the
    quotient of the counts for the three pair types, extracted from the
    set of sample graphs, with the number of expected pairs in Gilbert
    random graphs $G(n,p)$, where $n=1000$ and $p=0.116$ were matched
    to the sample graph parameters. While single connections appear
    less often than in Gilbert random graphs, reciprocal connections
    are significantly overrepresented. Errorbars SEM. \textbf{B)}
    Comparing appearance of connection pairs in the anisotropic sample
    graphs with their respective appearance in the rewired sample
    graphs, we find that eliminating anisotropy does not significantly
    change the counts for the connection types, indicating that
    anisotropy does not influence two neuron connection
    probabilities. Errorbars SEM.  (\smtcite{c5f1462b})}

We further support this observation by computing the probability
distribution for the expected number of edges between to random
vertices in the anisotropic graph model. For this we assume that only
the distance-dependent connection probability $C(x)$ determines the
occurrence of edges in vertex pairs in the anisotropic graph
model. Then, using the probability distribution $f(x)$ for the a
random neuron pair to be at distance $x$, we calculate
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{P}(X=0) & = \int_0^{\sqrt{2}} (1-C(x))^2 f(x)\,
dx, \\
\mathbf{P}(X=1) & = \int_0^{\sqrt{2}} 2 C(x) (1-C(x)) f(x) \, dx \quad \mathrm{and}\\
\mathbf{P}(X=2) & = \int_0^{\sqrt{2}} C(x)^2 f(x) \, dx. 
\end{align*}
Inserting the distance-dependent connection probabilities $C(x)$ in
the anisotropic graph model as computed in
Theorem~\ref{theorem:distance_prof} and the probability distribution
$f(x)$ from Theorem~\ref{theorem:distance_square} we obtain
\begin{align*} 
\mathbf{P}(X=0) & = 0.791336 && 0.7907  \pm 0.0008\\
\mathbf{P}(X=1) & = 0.184151 && 0.1846  \pm 0.0007\\
\mathbf{P}(X=2) & = 0.024513 && 0.02462  \pm 0.00009,
\end{align*}
perfectly matching the probabilities extracted from anisotropic sample
graphs in the right column (error SEM, \smtcite{c5f1462b}). Noting
that distance-dependency alone is sufficient to accurately predict
edge probabilities in neuron pairs in the anisotropic network model
and combined with the observations in \autoref{fig:two_neuron_probs},
we conclude that varying degrees of anisotropy do not affect the
occurrence of neuron pair motifs.
