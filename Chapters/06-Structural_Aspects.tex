  of the brain's connectivity is an ongoing endeavour.  Concurrent
  collaborative efforts like the Human Connectome Project
  [\textcolor{linkgrey}{HCP}]%??
  , the Open Connectome Project [\textcolor{linkgrey}{OCP}]%??
  and the Allen Brain Atlas [\textcolor{linkgrey}{ABA}]%??
  , intent on mapping the 'wiring' of the brain, as well as the
  continued development of experimental techniques and computational
  resources, demonstrate \marginpar{Open Connectome Project
    \href{http://www.openconnectomeproject.org/}{openconnectomeproject.org}}the
  great interest in advancing this field.

Research in brain connectivity spreads over the whole scale \marginpar{\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=1.\linewidth]{img/AllenBrainLogo.png}\end{center}\vspace{-0.3cm}\mbox{\textrm{\href{http://www.brain-map.org/}{brain-map.org}}}} of the
brain; from the mapping of fiber pathways between brain regions at the
macroscopic level, to the synaptic connections of individual neurons
on the microscale, researchers are trying to identify the links that
enable the brain its characteristic cognitive abilities.
%Macroscale: Can cite Sporns2004
In the search for structural connections, these links are of
anatomical nature. However, statistical dependencies and causal
relationships between the distinct computational units in the brain
are being researched with equal emphasis \parencite{Scholarpedia-BrainConnectivity}.

Connectivity in the context of the directionally heterogenous
geometric networks introduced %?? wording
 in Section~\ref{sec:anisotropic_network_model}, refers in this chapter to
structural links. So far, we have only briefly mentioned that the
network's nodes should be interpreted as individual neurons; to allow
for a discussion of functional relationships between nodes, we have yet
to provided a physical description of a neuron's function. As such, we
will here explore the network's structural connectivity, modeling
synaptic contacts between axon and dendrites of individual neurons.


\subsection*{Synaptic Connectivity}

In the local cortical circuits the anisotropic geometric model was
derived from, synaptic connectivity is a major mode of configuration.
In those networks, connectivity has been determined to be neither
completely random nor exclusively specific
[\textcolor{linkgrey}{Source}].%??
Recurring patterns of connectivity have been identified by several
reports \parencite{Sporns2004,Song2005,Perin2011}.

The impact of this structural specifity discovered in local networks
is shown to be significant; while the linking of network structure and
network dynamics remains an active field of research, several studies
were able to employ computational and theoretical models to establish
such a connection. A study by Zhao et al. from 2011, for example,
demonstrates how second order connectivity statistics affect a
network's propensity to synchronize
\parencite{Zhao2011}. In the same year, Alex Roxin
reported on the influence of in- and out-degree distributions on
dynamics of neural network \parencite{Roxin2011}. Later,
Pernice et al. were able to link structural connectivity to spike
train correlations in neural networks
\parencite{Pernice2011}.


\subsection*{Mapping synaptic connectivity in experiments}

Experimentally, paired intracellular recordings are used to determine
synaptic connectivity in cortical slices. Using two electrodes, one
inserted in the cell and one outside the cell, a single intracellular
recording allows for measurement of a cell's membrane potential
\parencites[Chapter 3]{Brette_Neural-activity}[]{Scholarpedia-IntracellularRecording}. Simultaneous
recordings from multiple neurons are then able to infer synaptic
connectivity by evoking an action potential through current injection
in one neuron and observing the change of membrane potential in the
other cells \parencite{Song2005}.

\vspace{0.45cm}

While techniques for paired intracellular recordings are rapidly
developing, their ability to capture connectivity patterns of large
networks is yet very limited. To this date, the connectome of
\textit{C. Elegans} remains the outstanding exception of a
connectivity configuration that has been fully mapped
[\textcolor{linkgrey}{Source}]%??
. Even in the state-of-the-art experiment conducted by Perin et al.,
using a setup capable of recording up to twelve neurons
simultaneously, the authors note that an investigation of degree
distribution was not carried out, due to lack of sufficient data
\parencite{Perin2011}.

\subsection*{Exploiting the benefits of a geometrical model}

Working with a geometrical network model and its computational
implementation, such restrictions disappear; the full information
about the network, in form of its connectivity matrix, is given at
point in time and can be easily queried for. Experiments that may take
days to perform \textit{in vivo}, can be completed in a matter of seconds \textit{in
silico}. As such, geometrical models lend themselves to extensive
examination of their structural aspects.

In trying to exploit these advantages, two approaches present
themselves. One may construct a network model that
extrapolates\graffito{Extrapolation vs. reduction} the known
biological configuration; a full structural examination of these
networks could possibly expose relevant patterns not yet observed. For
this approach a sophisticated understanding of the biological
configuration is critical. Neuron morphology, however, is difficult to
describe and extract.

For this analysis we suggest a reductionist approach. Having motivated
an abstract model reflecting a cortical network's directional
heterogeneity, we distinguish emerging patterns of connectivity,
specific to directionally heterogeneous networks, from results, that
only indirectly stem from the network's anisotropy, in the hopes to be
able to characterize the significance of directional heterogeneity in
structural connectivity of cortical circuits.


\subsection*{Structural aspects of the heterogeneous model}

In this chapter we subject the directionally heterogeneous network
model introduced in Section~\ref{sec:anisotropic_network_model} to a
critical analysis of its structural aspects. General network topology,
as well as specific modes and patterns of connectivity, are to be
identified and laid out for comparison with findings in biological
neural networks.

In an effort to map out structural features that can be directly
associated with the network's directional \marginpar{employing
  anisotropy measure} heterogeneity, it is crucial to differentiate
such findings from results that are only indirectly caused by the
network's anisotropy. To this end, already in ?? we developed a
measure to quantify the degree of anisotropy prevalent in a given
network; throughout this chapter we will now frequently employ this
measure to determine which structural aspects are originating from the
network's heterogeneity, and which aspects are to be attributed solely
to the network's distance dependency.

Accordingly, results from this investigation are categorized in two
sections: The first section, 'Section 2' %??
, describes structural aspects that can not be directly attributed to
the model's anisotropy. The second section, 'Section 3' %??
, then presents results that are truly features of network's
directional heterogeneity.
