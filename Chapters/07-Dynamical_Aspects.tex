\chapter{Outlook: Dynamical Aspects}\label{ch:dynamical_aspects}
%************************************************

So far the focus of this study lay in uncovering how anisotropy
affects structural aspects of geometric neural networks. Finding that
higher order connectivity is indeed strongly influenced by anisotropy,
the question arises if and how anisotropy affects dynamical aspects as
well. As we studies repeatedly the first question is bound to be
answered positively. In this chapter, as an outlook, we show how
anisotropy can concretely affect network dynamics.

For this

In a network of $N$ neurons, let $f$ be the fraction of excitatory
neurons,
\[f:= \frac{N_E}{N_E + N_I},
\] if $N_E$ and $N_I$ are the number of neurons respectively.
Balanced network. 

% Sadeh 2014:
% We refer to the network as being “inhibition
% dominated”, if the lower number of inhibitory neurons
% is compensated for by stronger inhibitory weights. In the
% case considered here, this amounts to the condition g >
% NE/NI = f /(1 − f ) (Brunel 2000).
