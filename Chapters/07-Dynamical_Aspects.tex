\chapter{Outlook: Dynamical Aspects}\label{ch:dynamical_aspects}
%************************************************

So far the focus of this study lay in uncovering how anisotropy
affects structural aspects of geometric neural networks. Finding that
higher order connectivity is indeed strongly influenced by anisotropy,
the question arises if and how anisotropy affects dynamical aspects as
well. As we studies repeatedly the first question is bound to be
answered positively. In this chapter, as an outlook, we show how
anisotropy can concretely affect network dynamics.
