%************************************************

So far the focus of this study lay in uncovering how anisotropy
affects structural aspects of geometric neural networks. Finding that
higher order connectivity is indeed strongly influenced by anisotropy,
the question arises if and how anisotropy affects dynamical aspects as
well. The answer to the first question was heavily implied throughout
this thesis; referencing once again the convincing evidence of network
structure affects various dynamical aspects \parencite{Pernice2011,
  Zhao2011}, we expect that anisotropy does in fact display a strong
influence on dynamical aspects. The second question, however, is not
as easily answered and opens up a whole new direction of study, which
goes beyond the scope of this report. 

However, as an outlook to what surprising results one might find
investigating this topic we further, we here show how anisotropy in
connectivity affects network dynamics in a linear rate
model. Considering a system of $n$ neurons receiving some external
input $\mathbf{s}$, in such linear model the rate vector
$\mathbf{r}(t)$, describing the activity for each neuron at time $t$,
is governed the differential equation
\begin{equation}
  \dot{\mathbf{r}}  = -\mathbf{r} + W\mathbf{r} + J_S \mathbf{s},
\label{eq:dyn}
\end{equation}
where $W$ is the weight matrix of the network \parencite{Sadeh2014},
reflecting network connectivity. Each column in the $n \times n$
matrix corresponds to a neuron in the network, determining the neuron
either to be of inhibitory or excitatory nature. The weight matrix
then carries positive, non-zero entries in the columns of excitatory
neurons wherever an edge exists in the network, in short $W_{ij} \neq 0$
is a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of an edge
$e$ with $s(e) = j$ and $t(e) = i$. The columns of inhibitory neurons
carry non-zero, negative entries.

Without examining the equation in detail, we note how solutions of
(\ref{eq:dyn}) are determined by the eigenvalue spectrum of $W$. We
therefore here analyze the eigenvalue spectrum of the weight matrix
for anisotropic networks. For this we choose the following, typically
used parameters resembling an \textit{inhibition dominated
  network} \parencite{Brunel2000, Sadeh2014}. First we determine
randomly $f=0.2$ of all neurons to be inhibitory, the rest being
excitatory. Weights for existing edges are then gives as
$J=\SI{0.136}{mV}$ in the excitatory case and $-gJ$ in the inhibitory
case, making up with $g=8$ for the smaller population.


Analyzing then eigenvalue spectrum of weight matrices of anisotropic
and rewired networks, we clearly identify . While (computed as
described in \textcite{Rajan2006}), finding the first hint of
dynamical aspects directly influenced by anisotropy.
