% The fundamental computational units in brain networks are neurons,
% cells that have action potential. Neurons themselves are linked
% together through synapses, forming an expansive network. in cortical
% networks these are mainly of chemical nature, releasing. While
% networks are considered sparse, pyramidalI cells typically receive N
% inputs, making constituting an overall connectivity of about 0.1 in
% local networks.

% Synaptic contacts are inherently asymmetric. Although spike back
% propagation, action potentials. From the cell body (soma) of the
% neuron. The presynaptic rewiring is the axon. Morphology of axon and
% dendrite are characteristically different.

% Brain networks. They are well presented by the mathematical object of
% a directed graph, which will be discussed in detail in the next
% chapter.
