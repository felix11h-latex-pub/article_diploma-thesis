The fundamental computational units in brain networks are neurons,
cells that have action potential. Neurons are linked through synapses,
in cortical networks these are mainly of chemical nature,
releasing. While networks are considered sparse, pyramidalI cells
typically receive N inputs, making constituting an overall
connectivity of about 0.1 in local networks.

Synaptic contacts are inherently asymmetric. Although spike back
propagation, action potentials
