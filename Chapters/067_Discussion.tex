In their study \textcite{Perin2011} were able to relate increased
edge-counts in neuron clusters to a \textit{common neighbor rule} - a
specific relationship between common in- or outputs in a neuron pair
and the probability for the pair to be connected - identifying an
underlying principle for the occurrence of non-random connectivity in
local circuits. Perin et al.\ suggest that (fire together wire
together). In this structural analysis we found non-random
connectivity resembling the findings of Song et al./ and , purely from
a g. Identifying a common neighbor rule as the inherent, that
non-random connectivity statistics might arrise from morphological
restrictions rather than plastic processes.
