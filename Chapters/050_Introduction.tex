This chapter introduces the central object of this study, the
\textit{anisotropic network model}. Reviewing connectivity in local
cortical circuits in Section~\ref{sec:biol_anisotropy}, we find
evidence of anisotropy in connectivity that we try capture in the
network model introduced in
Section~\ref{sec:anisotropic_network_model}. Building a simple and
abstract model, Forcing this specific
geometry in network however, causes for . For our ana
