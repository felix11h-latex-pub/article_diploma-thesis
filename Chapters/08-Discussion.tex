In the search for an underlying connectivity principle for the highly
non-random feature we anatomically introduced
(Section~\ref{sec:biol_anisotropy}) anisotropy in connectivity.

It is to be assumed that this structural influence highly affect
network dynamics as well, in this study we presented linking
anisotropy to dynamical stability.
