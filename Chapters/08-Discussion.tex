In the search for an underlying connectivity principle for the highly
non-random feature we anatomically introduced
(Section~\ref{sec:biol_anisotropy}) anisotropy in connectivity.

It is to be assumed that this structural influence highly affect
network dynamics as well, in this study we presented linking
anisotropy to dynamical stability.

identifying network connectivity and specifically anatomy as an
important contender for underlying connectivity rules in cortical networks.
