\section{Tuning Distance-dependency}\label{sec:tuned_networks}

The discussion in the last section focused on the effect of anisotropy
in connectivity on the occurrence of neuron pair motifs. Could
distance-dependency itself, as imposed by the specific geometry, be a
decisive factor in the distribution of edge counts in neuron pairs?
\textcite{Song2005}, as well as \textcite{Perin2011}, report an
overrepresentation of reciprocal connections independent from
distance-dependent connectivity, opposing the observations made in the
last section (\autoref{fig:two_neuron_probs} A). Furthermore, the
connectivity profile in the anisotropic graph model, as identified in
Section~\ref{sec:distance_connectivity}, follows purely from abstract
geometry rather than being motivated by connectivity found in cortical
circuits. In an attempt to rectify this and to allow for a more
differentiated examination of two neuron connections, in this section
we step away from simplistic geometry and \enquote{tune} the
anisotropic networks to display a distance-dependent connectivity as
reported by Perin et al. by adjusting the width $w(x)$ at any point
$x$ along the axon's projection.

For this we introduce anisotropic networks tuned to reflect a given
distance-dependent connection profile $C(x)$. We are facing the
following problem: Given $C(x):[0,\sqrt{2}) \to [0,1]$, find
$w:[0,\sqrt{2}) \to [0,\infty)$ such that the probability to have a
connection from $v_1$ to $v_2$ for arbitrary vertices $v_1 \neq v_2$
in an anisotropic graph $G(n,w)$ with distance $\mathrm{d}(v_1,v_2) =
x$ is $C(x)$. The problem is in general highly complex when nothing
can be assumed about $C(x)$. We find an approximate solution to the
problem considering the following geometric relation:

  \caption{Computing connection probability $C(x)$ from non-constant
    $w(x)$}
  \label{fig:dpp_wc}
\end{figure}

From \autoref{fig:dpp_wc} we have the relation  
\begin{equation}
C\left(\sqrt{x^2+w^2(x)}\right) = \frac{1}{\pi} \operatorname{arctan}
\frac{w(x)}{x}. \label{eq:geo_rel}
\end{equation} 
In order to solve for $w(x)$ we first consider a linear approximation,
expanding
\[C\left(\sqrt{x^2+w^2(x)}\right) \approx C(x) + \left(\sqrt{x^2+w^2(x)} -
x\right) C'(x).\]

The resulting transcendental equation
\[C(x) + \left(\sqrt{x^2+w^2(x)} -
x\right) C'(x) = \frac{1}{\pi} \operatorname{arctan}
\frac{w(x)}{x}\]
is however still too complex in the context of this work. Instead we
propose the approximation $\sqrt{x^2 + w^2(x)} \approx  x$, which
inserting into \ref{eq:geo_rel} yiels
\begin{equation}
C(x) \approx \frac{1}{\pi} \operatorname{arctan} \label{eq:tanapprox}
\frac{w(x)}{x}.
\end{equation}

Under the assumption that $C(x)<\frac{1}{2}$ for all $x$ we obtain the
identity
\begin{equation}
  w(x) = x \tan\left( \pi\, C(x) \right), \label{eq:xtan}
\end{equation} 
being aware that it only holds as well as
approximation~\ref{eq:tanapprox} does. 

Here we use relation~\ref{eq:xtan} to generate anisotropic networks
reflecting the dis\-tance-de\-pendent connectivity profile as found by
\textcite{Perin2011}. For this we finally need to adjust the before
arbitrarily determined side length of the network's surface. Perin et
al.~mapped connectivity in layer 5 of the rat's somatosensory cortex
up to a distance of $\SI{300}{\micro\meter}$. Using this reported
distance connectivity to generate anisotropic networks via
\ref{eq:xtan}, the chosen side length $s$ determines the networks
overall connectivity (\autoref{fig:determine_side_length} A). We
determine $s = \SI{296}{\micro\meter}$ to match the overall connection
probability of $p = 0.116$ as used before and reported by Song et
al.~(\autoref{fig:determine_side_length} B). The obtained value for
$s$ is consistent with the slice thickness of \SI{300}{\micro\meter}
used in Perin et al.'s experiment.

Having determined the neotwork's side length $s$, we're extending the
quiver of generated sample networks for the numerical analysis once
more by the \enquote{tuned anisotropic graphs} \index{tuned
  anisotropic networks}, in which the axon width $w(x)$ was determined
such that the networks reflect Perin's connectivity profile. Analyzing
the obtained axon width function we note that $x \gg w(x)$ holds for
most $x$, justifying the approximation
\[
  \sqrt{x^2 + w^2(x)} \approx x
\] 
\textit{a posteriori} (\autoref{fig:perin_axwidth}). From the 25
generated networks overall connection probability is extracted as $p =
0.1160 \pm 0.0006$ (SEM), as expected from the choice of $s$
(\smtcite{f11dca65}).



% This approximation holds well as long as $x \gg w(x)$. Using the

Overall distance-dependent connection probabilities in the tuned
an\-iso\-tro\-pic graphs clearly match the profile of Perin et
al.~(\autoref{fig:perin_profiles} A), presenting strongest the
argument in support of the chosen approximation. Analyzing two neuron
connections \marginpar{revisiting two neuron connections} in the tuned
networks, we affirm the findings of the last section. In their
experiment, Perin et al.~were able to show an overrepresentation of
reciprocal connections at any inter-neuron distance
(\autoref{fig:perin_profiles} B-C). Rather than matching these
profiles, we find that occurrences of one- and bidirectionally
connected pairs in the anisotropic graphs align with probabilities
obtained from the distance-dependent overall connection probability
$p(x)$ under the assumption of independence (cf. Equation~\ref{eq:pairs}),
\begin{equation*}
  \label{eq:pairs}
  \begin{aligned}%
    & \mathbf{P}_{X=1}(x) = 2p(x) \left(1-p(x) \right)    
      && \text{single connection,}\\
    & \mathbf{P}_{X=2}(x) = p(x)^2        
      &&\text{reciprocal connection.}
  \end{aligned}%
\end{equation*}%
\vspace{0.1cm}%
Thus, in comparison with Perin et al.'s findings, we find that
anisotropy in connectivity cannot account for the overrepresentation
in reciprocal connections. While results in
Section~\ref{sec:two_neuron} still indicated such an
overrepresentation due to distance-dependency, examining the
occurrence of two neuron connections at any inter-neuron distance in
anisotropic networks, tuned to a distance-dependent connection profile
matching experimental findings from cortical circuits, imply complete
unrelatedness of anisotropy and two-neuron connection distributions.
