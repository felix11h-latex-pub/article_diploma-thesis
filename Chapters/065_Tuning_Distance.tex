Stepping away, we 




Maybe simplicity of the model makes stuff wrong. Tune to Perin
distance profile.

Let 

In their study, \textcite{Perin2011} heavily rely on a
distance-dependent 


Here we introduce anisotropic networks tuned to reflect a given
distance-dependent connection profile. We face the following: Given
$C(x):[0,\sqrt{2}) \to [0,1]$, choose $w(x)$ such that the probability
to have a vertex is $C(x)$ $G_n,w$.

From ?? we have the relation ??. This however assumes . 

\[
C\left(\sqrt{x^2+w^2(x)}\right) = \frac{1}{\pi} \operatorname{arctan}
\frac{w(x)}{x}
\] 



Instead we propose the approximation $\sqrt{x^2 + w^2(x)} \approx  x$,
giving
\[
C(x) \approx \frac{1}{\pi} \operatorname{arctan} \label{eq:tanapprox}
\frac{w(x)}{x}.
\] 

This approximation holds well as long as $x \gg w(x)$.
