\chapter*{Abstract}

Non-random connectivity has been repeatedly reported in cortical
networks, yet underlying connection principles of these patterns
remain elusive. Proposing an abstract geometric network model
reflecting stereotypical axonal and dendritic morphology of local
cortical layer 5 networks, we here investigate in how far anisotropy
in connectivity can constitute such an underlying connectivity
rule. Using a combination of analytical considerations and numerical
analysis, we find that while standard network measures and pair
connectivity remain unaffected, higher order connectivity is strongly
influenced by anisotropy, in many cases reflecting patterns found in
local cortical circuits. Presenting an abstract network model
featuring connectivity principles beyond distance-dependency, the
results shown here not only make a strong case for morphology-induced
rules as underlying connection principles of non-random patterns, but
may provide another step towards a network archetype greatly improving
upon the standard random model.
